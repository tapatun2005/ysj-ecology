It involved staff from four Schools conducting seven focus groups with 23 students from all programmes and year groups, facilitated by a YSJ MA student, and a survey involving 331 students, in summer 2020. It explored YSJU students' anxieties, sense of agency and expectations of the university around ecological justice. Phase 1 findings underlined the need to orient the university’s pedagogical approach to ecological justice around integrative concepts of systemic, structural change and alternative possible futures, which prepare students to help reshape and build the resilience of their workplaces and communities. The findings are informing the production of a book chapter and two journal articles, one focusing on student expectations, and the other on student agency. Four key themes identified from preliminary analysis of the focus group data informed the design of Phase 2.</p>" %}

Then, supported by the relevant staff members, each student researcher team set the research agenda around their theme, conducting the research, and organising and evaluating any actions. The students also came together as a larger team to share ideas, as well as coming together with the staff team to guide the direction of the individual projects and the wider project.</p><p>The student co-researchers have gained valuable research, presentation, and teamworking working experience, helping them develop many of the YSJU Graduate Attributes.</p><p>Discover some of our action research project outputs and findings and recommendations as you read on.</p>" %}
